  <h1>Video Game Genres I Enjoy</h1>
  <h2> Video Games</h2>
  <p> I mainly play video games and try to explore a multitude of genres to enjoy and experience. I play RPGs(JRPG's mainly), strategy titles,FPS and many others. </p>
  <h3> Pokemon Tournaments </h3>
  <p> I play and host online pokemon tournaments for fun. Using an online format we play a multitude of generations(older and newer pokemon main titles) and play in single battles of 6v6(6 pokemon per player). The format most commonly used would be similar to fantasy leagues but more hands on as you can use and customize the pokemon for your opponent specifically on a game to game basis. It's a fun way to add some competitive aspects to a game that many people enjoy. </p>
  <h3> Strategy Games </h3>
  <p> When I was young I got introduced to many classic tactical games like Total War:Medival 2 and the rest of the franchise. This grew my love for further tactical games that lead me to explore older and newer strategic games. One game I have enjoyed more recently has been Star Wars Empire At War which has a Star Wars twist to the strategy genre with ground battle and space battles with their respective units.</p>
  <h3> FPS Games </h3>
  <p> While this is not my favorite genre I do play Valorant and Overwatch and try to improve
