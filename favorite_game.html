  <h1> What is GRIS?</h1>
    <p> Gris is a game that was developed by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital and is and Atmospheric Platformer.</p>
  <h1> What is GRIS about?</h1>
    <p>Gris follows a lost girl in a world where she deals with painful experiences from her life. The further you progress in the story the more you learn about the experiences and unlock new abilities that allow her to have new abilities that are associated with her dress. The further you get the more you learn about the environment and discover many beautiful areas.</p>

  <h1> Why I enjoy GRIS</h1>
    <p> The game has a beautiful way of showing the world and story telling through the environments, no words are used in the entire game though the story remains easy to follow. It doesn't have much action and doesn't really have a way to fail. The game is fairly short and led me to replaying the game multiple times to achieve all the possible achievements. The themes within the game are also very strong and the way the game adds colors to the map as we learn more about the girl is interesting and makes previous environments more beautiful to look at. </p>
  <h2> Further Information about the game</h2>
